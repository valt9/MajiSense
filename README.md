This project is a device that measures the water's turbidity, temperature, and pH. This is part of my NovaLab project for school. This design is to help people learn what is in their drinking water.

- [HiLetgo OLED screen](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XRBYJR8?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1)
- [DFROBOT analog turbidity sensor](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075T3CVH6?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title)
- [DS18B20 temperature sensor](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8J77NJR?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title)
- [Arduino Uno Rev3](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-uno-rev3?srsltid=AfmBOooq0MK1wtfph-lwjxDJ96BH1ft5lOGEP2697PZ50DQhbAN_b4dl)
- [3D printer](https://www.creality.com/products/ender-3-pro-3d-printer)
- [PETG Filament](https://a.co/d/1sE99OA)
  
A STEP file of the device case is added so you can print it yourself.
I printed it with PETG filament and at 100% infill so that no water can get into the device.
