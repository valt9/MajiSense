This project is a device that measures the water's turbidity, temperature, and pH. This is part of my NovaLab project for school. This design is to help people learn what is in their drinking water.

  A STEP file of the device case will be added soon so you can print it yourself.
  There will also be settings listed with the STEP file, I used to print the device
